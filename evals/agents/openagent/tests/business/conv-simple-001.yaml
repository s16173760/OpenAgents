name: Conversational Path (No Approval Needed)
description: |
  Tests the conversational execution path for pure questions.
  Validates that agent answers directly WITHOUT requesting approval.
  
  From openagent.md (Line 136-139):
  "Conversational path: Answer directly, naturally - no approval needed"
  "Examples: 'What does this code do?' (read) | 'How use git rebase?' (info)"
  
  Expected workflow:
  1. Analyze → Detect conversational path (no execution needed)
  2. Read file (allowed without approval)
  3. Answer directly
  4. Skip approval stage
